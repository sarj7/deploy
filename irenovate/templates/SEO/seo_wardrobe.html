			<p class="paraCommon">The storage requirement of an average home has been spiraling up, but the floor space of new homes has reduced significantly. Wardrobes with sliding doors are one such invention that has revolutionized the way we store items. There are small sliding wardrobes which can be customized to suit tiny spaces and large ones too, for rooms with big storage requirements. A conventional wardrobe takes up space  when its doors open in the front.  A sliding wardrobe comes to the rescue here ,by taking up only the space of a wardrobe , whereas you don’t need to leave much space for the radius of the door panel .Sliding wardrobe doors can be made from a wide variety of materials like frosted glass, mirrors, wood, metal and veneer .</p>
				
			<div>
				<p>Here are certain tips that you can use to make your sliding wardrobe last longer. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Always choose doors that run on wheels installed on top of the shutter rather than at the bottom of the shutter.</li>
					<li>Bottom running wheels over time can get sluggish due to accumulated dirt in the wheel channels.</li>
					<li>You can add LED lights, to make it appear more attractive , with translucent sliding doors. </li>
					<li>Try incorporating brushes in a wardrobe, so that dirt doesn’t accumulate in the corners of the closet.</li>
					<li>Try not to use particle board, MDF or ply as these don’t offer maximum resistance against bending.</li>
					<li>Put a small stopper at the end of the door so that it doesn’t recoil after banging on the other side.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You can use these tips to judiciously use your room space by redesigning your wardrobe.	</p>

All those celebrities out there have these kind of cabinets, with a separate drawer for their clothes, footwear , accessories , make up etc . Now you can also feel like a celebrity, 	with these type of wardrobes. You can display everything at one place in an organised manner. Walk-in wardrobes add a touch of luxury. Any unused room can easily be converted in a walk-in wardrobe by  adding shelves . Walk-in wardrobes are more expensive than the other ones. Their main benefit is easy access and easy-to-organise storage. But accommodating a walk-in wardrobe in small and medium sized homes is next to impossible.There’s a misconception that you need lots of room for a walk-in wardrobe. The type of storage you need simply comes down to what you own. These type of closets are an epitome of luxury. A dedicated place for your clothes and shoes is really all you need to make the walk-in closet a dream come true. </p>
