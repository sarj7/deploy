				Definitely renovation is important! Home renovation is not just about upgrading your home with new colors or fresh furniture or repairs but it is also about upgrading your lifestyle. Most people want their homes to be beautiful and reflective of who they are, so you can make your home the best place to live in with the help of  interior designs .
			</p>

			<p class="parag">
				Every worldly thing tends to depreciate in value, be it a vehicle, a utility item or home. A home is built to last for a lifetime, provided that it is being properly taken care of and renovated on a timely basis. The wrath of environmental factors, such as rain, snow, storms, earthquakes, floods, etc spares none. If your house has been a victim to any of the natural calamities, it is soon going to fall weak at some point in time. Therefore, renovation is mandatory in that case.
			</p>

			<p class="parag">
				Renovation gives some good appeal to your home . Its literally the best thing to invest in. The idea of renovating your home from time to time is the best thing since sliced bread . They offer a family a new way to experience their home and make changes to it that suit their needs without having to spend the money moving into  building a new home. Home renovation is not only important for the look of your home but it is also important because it keeps the family safe. Any part of your home may get worn out from too much use. This can pose danger especially the electrical aspect of the house because it may cause fire or any unwanted accident.
			</p>

			<p>There is a dire need of renovation if</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The house has got quite older than normal age. 
				</li>
				<li>Leaky roof and rifted walls.
				</li>
				<li>
					No storage space .
				</li>	
				<li>

				</li>
				<li>
					You can also consider removing some walls during your renovation to be able to have a much fresher and bigger space inside your house.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				Home renovation is important, not only because it can add to the aesthetic value of your home but it is also a way that can keep your homes in good condition, which in return can benefit you in such a way that it will provide more comfort in your homes.

				<h2>
					Renovation ideas for small homes – Make it look more spacious ! Here are some tips
				</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>
					When adding drapes to a room, make sure they’re the same color as your walls. Sticking to the same color will make your space look bigger. 
				</li>

				<li>
					Opt for sofas and armchairs that are raised on legs, which creates a sense of light and space.
				</li>

				<li>
					light and neutral color palettes make a space feel bigger and more open.
				</li>

				<li>
					Include mirrors in your space! The reflection will make a room look bigger.
				</li>

				<li>
					Make a small room look bigger with expansive counter tops in the kitchen.
				</li>

				<li>
					Buy some of your furniture in the same color as your walls, that way it simply blends in and will widen your space.
				</li>

				<li>
					Don’t automatically place your furniture against walls. Sometimes placing a piece at an angle or surrounded by open space, will make a room look  bigger 
				</li>

				<li>
					If possible, avoid heavy materials and fabrics that absorb light and weigh your room down. 
				</li>

				<li>
					Avoid too many knickknacks or at least group them so they read as an installation.
				</li>

				<li>
					Using a bright color for your ceiling will drive they eye upward, creating the illusion of a higher ceiling.

				Renovation ideas for kitchen
			</h2>

			<p>
				The kitchen is undeniably the heart and soul of our home. It is where we prepare our favorite meal to energize our day. So, it is understandable why we want to make our kitchen look great.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Material choices - House Renovation Ideas Interiors
			</h2>
			<p>
				There are many material options for modular kitchens. People make choices depending upon their preferences and budget. Some common materials include natural wood (of various types like teak, deciduous, maple, and pine), ply, laminates, fiber boards (of which medium-density fiberboard or MDF is widely used), stainless steel, and aluminum. Often, a combination of these can also be used depending upon the design preferences.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
			 		When you prepare your meals , you mainly use 3 things-
				 	<ul>
				 		<li>
				 			USE SINK
				 		</li>
				 		<li>
				 			USECOOKING RANGE 
				 		</li>
				 		<li>
				 			USE FRIDGE 
				 		</li>
				 	</ul>
				 	Hence , every kitchen has 3 main corners and when you use your kitchen , you are moving between these corners .For efficient kitchen , make sure triangle is neither  too big  too small nor too small and there are no obstructing objects in the middle of this triangle .
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Keep an over-the-sink cutting board handy to temporarily expand your counter space.
				</li>

				<li>
					Adding some  plants to your kitchen creates the illusion of a luxurious, well-kept space. Try placing a long-leafed houseplant in an open corner. Adding some green, leafy life will perk up your kitchen.
				</li>

				<li>
					Get the right rug for your kitchen decor .
				</li>

				<li>
					Paint just one or two of your kitchen walls to create a new focal point, and use a color that complements your cabinetry in this way you will be able to create so called your “dream kitchen” and make your kitchen decor attractive.
				</li>

				<li>
					Hanging racks are inexpensive and easy to install and they can be painted to match the rest of your decor if desired. 
				</li>
			</ul>
