				<p class="common">
					 Modular kitchen designs have revolutionized the kitchen decor all over the world. The term `modular 'means that your kitchen is made up of several modules or units. Gone are those days when homes were big and every part of the house had ample space for proper design and furniture installations. With time, houses and apartments are becoming smaller. You can literally go bananas , finding a good , reasonable home for yourself .But what everyone can afford to do is design the available space as per preference. Ensuring that everything is well organized and decently decorated with the available space is the main aim of today’s homeowners. Modular kitchens come to the rescue here.You can clearly make out the difference when  you wear designer clothes and clothes made by your neighbourhood tailor . Same is the case with modular and traditional kitchens . Make your cooking experience even more enjoyable , by installing modular kitchen .
				</p>
				<p class="common">
					Design options for a modular kitchen:&nbsp;Gallery kitchens, island kitchens, and U- and L-shaped kitchens are the most popular options.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>i. Gallery kitchens have parallel counters and is the most effective option in the case of space constraints.</li>
					<li>ii. Island kitchens are designed in such a way that the cooking space is in the middle of the kitchen, storage is on one side, and the other side is open towards the rest of the house.</li>
					<li>iii. U-shaped kitchens are often a preference of homeowners with a larger kitchen space; they require three adjacent walls.</li>
					<li>iv. The  L-shaped kitchen consists of countertops on two adjoining walls that are perpendicular, forming an L.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="common"><span style="font-size: 1.1em;">Material choices: &nbsp;</span>There are many material options for modular kitchens. People make choices depending upon their preferences and budget. Some common materials include natural wood (of various types like teak, deciduous, maple, and pine), ply, laminates, fiber boards (of which medium-density fiberboard or MDF is widely used), stainless steel, and aluminum. Often, a combination of these can also be used depending upon the design preferences.</p>

		<p class="paraCommon">With time, houses and apartments are becoming smaller. So the need of the hour is to utilize the given small space in an efficient manner and making the kitchen look more spacious .Here are certain tips which will make your kitchen look more spacious and at the same time will save your money too.</p>

		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Marine ply in kitchen</b> Plywood inside any area of your home that gets wet frequently should be marine . Marine ply are costlier than the other ones but will last longer as compared to the other types of ply .</li>
				<li><b>Stain steel hinges below sink</b> Sink gets in touch with water all the time .So make sure the hinges below sink are of stainless steel , otherwise they will rust with time . They are a little costlier than the regular hinges , but in long run , they will pay off.</li>
				<li><b>Parallel kitchen platforms</b>Parallel kitchen platforms are the best . In L shape , the corner never gets utilized properly .Parallel kitchens offer best functionality for using your kitchen efficiently .Utlisation of space and ease of usage is high .</li>
				<li><b>Kitchen triangle </b>When you prepare your meals , you mainly use 3 things:</br>
					<ul>
						<li>USE SINK</li>
						<li>USECOOKING RANGE</li>
						<li>USE FRIDGE</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Hence , every kitchen has 3 main corners and when you use your kitchen , you are moving between these corners .For efficient kitchen , make sure triangle is neither  too big  too small nor too small and there are no obstructing objects in the middle of this triangle .Keep an over-the-sink cutting board handy to temporarily expand your counter space.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Create extra counter space by buying an over-the-sink shelf.
				</li>
				<li>
					Install a hanging rack, and keep  kitchen essentials out of the way but within easy reach.
				</li>
				<li>
					When organizing your kitchen, it’s easy to forget the dark area below the sink. Stop tossing in the miscellaneous cleaning supplies, and give them a space that’s all their own.
				</li>
				<li>
					Simply going with a single rather than double bowl for the sink can save you a foot or more of counter space.
				</li>
				<li>
					Install  cabinets on both sides of the kitchen .
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="paraCommon">As far as the old kitchens are concerned they were dingy and unorganized. Modular kitchens of today are designed to suit individual needs and optimize space . Depending on your needs and preferences, a traditional kitchen can be one of the most expensive rooms in your home.Modular kitchens, unlike traditional kitchens, are purchased as assembled modular structures. Instead of designing each piece separately, you will purchase modular kitchen as complete units. All pieces – from cabinets to counter tops – will come as a complete package. You will buy pre-made cabinets, including all parts, even the hardware, counter tops, and anything that is included in the kitchen arrangement. Modular kitchens can come in a variety of styles, designs, colors, and accessories. Some of the more popular and high-end styles of kitchens incorporate stainless steel cabinets and accessories as well as ultra-modern designs.Modular kitchens are also durable and make a perfect option in small, urban spaces as it can easily be integrated in the space available .  </p>

			<p class="paraCommon">hough installation of modular kitchen is expensive, however it is of worth when it comes to luxury and elegant design of modular kitchen systems. The currently prevailing perception is that modular kitchens are expensive. However, if you consider what you are getting in a modular kitchen, its cost might just be justified. The price of a modular kitchen will depend upon factors like area, design, and materials used for the drawers, counters, trolleys, etc. As there are so many factors that critically affect the cost of modular kitchens in India, talking about the final cost won’t be possible until and unless you consult an interior designer and let them know what you want and what you do not want in your kitchen. However, according to customer experiences thus far, modular kitchens tend to be more expensive than conventional kitchens.</br>The range of modular kitchen starts from Rs 5000 and can  go upto Rs 5 lakhs. Here are some cost estimates&nbsp;–
			<ul>
				<li>
					L shape kitchen starts from – Rs 1,20,000
				</li>
				<li>
					U shape – Rs 1,60,000
