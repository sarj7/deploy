            Be it changing the whole look of your room with false ceiling and awesome lighting system or making your room look more spacious or suggesting the material you should use for the flooring, an interior designer  will help you throughout, till you get the desired look for your home. </br>
            An interior designer's job is not just about picking out colors and fabrics to make a space more beautiful, it concerns itself with adding life to your humdrum looking home. Interior designers must make sure all of the work is completed on time. The designer has to coordinate with the painters, wallpaper designers, electricians, furniture manufacturers, fabric wholesalers and work as a team. Stainless steel, kitchenware/appliances, modern furniture, and florescent lighting, they know it all! They make the dullest spaces more inspiring. </br>
            An interior designer should consider the overall space of a home and its individual rooms, what are the dimensions of the space and how was it constructed. The pros and cons of a space, pros and cons of materials to be used for renovating the house should be considered. Some of the practical considerations that should be considered are the lighting, the sound, seating arrangements.
