				Be it changing the whole look of your room with false ceiling and awesome lighting system or making your room look more spacious or suggesting  the material you should use for the flooring ,an  interior designer  will help you throughout, till you get the desired look for your home.
				An interior designer's job is  not just about picking out colors and fabrics to make a space more beautiful, it concerns itself with adding life to your humdrum looking home . Interior designers must  make sure all of the work is completed on time. The designer has to coordinate with the painters, wallpaper designers, electricians, furniture manufacturers, fabric wholesalers and work as a team . Stainless steel, kitchenware/appliances, modern furniture, and florescent lighting, they know it all! They make  the dullest spaces more inspiring.
				An interior designer should consider the overall space of a home and its individual rooms, what are the dimensions of the space and how was it constructed. The pros and cons of a space , pros and cons of  materials to be used for renovating the house should be considered .Some of the practical considerations that should be considered are the lighting, the sound, seating arrangements.

				Interior decoration and Interior designing – know the difference!
			</h2>
		</center>
		<div class="container container_synonym2	">
			Interior designer or  interior decorator? Sounds similar! Right? Though, "Interior design" and "interior decorating" are interchangeably used by people but there is a thin line of demarcation between the both.
			Interior designers must have the technical expertise to know the vast array of options that they can apply to any one space.  Interior design is about both art and science and how to use these two disciplines in creating a beautiful outcome. Technical knowledge is required for it to know the ergonomics and dimensions of a space.
			Interior decorating is mainly about using various forms of color and accents to make a particular space more visually appealing. Interior decorating is strictly about the art .No technical knowledge is needed for it .All the DIY sections involve interior decoration rather than interior designing as it does not involve much of technical jargon .You can be an interior decorator , but to become an interior designer , you need to know the technical know how of it ! 
			So the next time, someone uses both these words interchangeably, do correct them! Because these similar sounding words have quite different meanings.
